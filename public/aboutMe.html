          I love building and fixing applications. I currently work as a Tier 3
          Support Engineer for Azure App Services, Azure Functions, and Azure
          Static Web Apps. I'm on the Development/Open Source Software team, so
          I spent a lot of time working with deployments and pipelines (Github
          Actions and Azure DevOps), and also providing architectural
          advice/support for people building web apps and APIs in various
          langugages, like node.js, python, php, and java.
        </p>

          I've worked at my current company for about 2 years. Before that, I
          lived and worked for 3 and a half years in Democratic Republic of
          Congo. I worked as a teacher, and accompanied various organizations
          that were working for peace and development around the country. During
          my time there, I was frustrated by the lack of economic opportunity,
          which I believed was a central driver of all the other problems. I
          then became interested in technology, because I believe it's one of
          the central drivers of economic opportunity in our world today.
